### **ðŸ“Œ Understanding Type Casting in Java**

In **Java**, **type casting** refers to **converting** a variable from one data type to another. This is important because sometimes you need to perform operations between different data types or store a value of one type into a variable of a different type.

Type casting can be divided into two main types:
- **Implicit (Automatic) Type Casting**
- **Explicit (Manual) Type Casting**

---

## **ðŸ”¹ What is Implicit Type Casting (Automatic)?**
- **Occurs automatically** by the Java compiler.
- Happens when you **convert** from a **smaller** data type to a **larger** one.  
  Example: Converting from `int` to `long`, `float` to `double`.

### **Example of Implicit Type Casting:**
```java
public class ImplicitCasting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1 = 100;  // int data type
        double num2 = num1;  // Implicit casting (int to double)
        
        System.out.println("Value of num2: " + num2);  // Output: 100.0
    }
}
```

ðŸ”‘ **Key Points:**
- Java automatically converts `int` to `double` because a `double` can hold all values of an `int` without losing precision.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ What is Explicit Type Casting (Manual)?**
- **Requires you to manually convert** the data type using a cast operator.
- Happens when you convert from a **larger** data type to a **smaller** one.  
  Example: Converting from `double` to `int`.

### **Example of Explicit Type Casting:**
```java
public class ExplicitCasting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double num1 = 9.99;  // double data type
        int num2 = (int) num1;  // Explicit casting (double to int)
        
        System.out.println("Value of num2: " + num2);  // Output: 9
    }
}
```

ðŸ”‘ **Key Points:**
- The `(int)` before `num1` tells the Java compiler to **explicitly convert** the `double` value to an `int`.  
- **Warning:** The fractional part (`.99`) is **lost** during the conversion.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Why is Type Casting Important?**
- **Implicit casting** happens automatically and makes it easier to work with larger data types.
- **Explicit casting** is needed when you want to fit a larger data type into a smaller one, but be cautious since data might get **truncated** or **rounded off**.

## **ðŸ”— Summary Table**

| **Type Casting**        | **Direction**            | **Automatic or Manual?** | **Example**       |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Implicit Casting**     | Smaller to Larger (e.g., `int` to `double`) | Automatic               | `int num = 10; double result = num;` |
| **Explicit Casting**     | Larger to Smaller (e.g., `double` to `int`)  | Manual (requires cast)  | `double num = 9.99; int result = (int) num;` |
